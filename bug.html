I'm using Tailwind CSS and I've noticed that sometimes my styles aren't applied correctly, especially when using complex classes or nested components.  The issue is intermittent and hard to reproduce consistently. The browser's developer tools don't show any obvious errors, and the Tailwind configuration seems correct.
